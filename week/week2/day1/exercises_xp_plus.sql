CREATE TABLE students(
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR (100) NOT NULL,
    birth_date DATE NOT NULL
);


-- Insert the data to the students table.
INSERT INTO students(id, first_name, last_name, birth_date) 
VALUES (1, 'Marc', 'Benichou', '1998-11-02'),
       (2, 'Yoan', 'Cohen', '2010-12-03'),
       (3, 'Lea', 'Benichou', '1987-07-27'),

       (5, 'David', 'Grez', '2003-06-14'),
       (6, 'Omer', 'Simpson', '1980-10-03');

INSERT INTO students(id, first_name, last_name, birth_date)
